Right off the bat, let me say that this isn't perfect, but it will tide me over
until full support for the Hauppauge HD PVR 1212 is released in 0.22.

Limitations:

1) The current version only records to the native AVS format and copies it to
the default video gallery(/var/lib/mythtv/videos/).  No mysql integration yet,
but it's basically ready to go.

2) You will probably have play around with the video players to see which one
plays the files best for you.  Depending on what extra options you set, your
player may choke on it  Try all the different players:
(INTERNAL vs VLC vs MPLAYER vs XINE vs ???).

3) Must schedule the recording manually or with a cron job in /etc/crontab
(which is what I do).  Yeah, a cron job is a pain, but for my weekly/daily
shows, all I do is set it once and it's done.

What it does do:

1) Changes channels, records, and moves to the gallery (or wherever you want).

2) Lots of command line switches and code ready for importing into mythtv mysql
database.


What I need help with.

1) running ffmpeg (without the need for sudo) so that the files are owned by
mythtv:mythtv.  This way, when I can import into the mythtv mysql database,
mythtv can then delete them.


Secondary problems:

1) I've noticed that the location of the device (i.e. /dev/video0) sometimes
changes.  It would be nice to lock it down.  I have other deivces and they
sometimes switch places.

2) The IR blaster/transmitter also stops working after every reboot.  I have to
go into the MythBuntu Control Center, change the device to anything else and
then back...strange.


Assumptions:

1) You either have your IR Blaster working or don't care about changing the
channel.

2) The device driver for the HD PVR is installed and working.  See...
http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Hauppauge_HD-PVR It assumes you are running
SVN/Trunk, so ignore the bottom.  Why don't I use svn or trunk?  Cuz I tried
and it screwed up everything so bad I had to reformat and reinstall
mythbuntu....I'm not nerdy enough...I admit it.


You'll notice lots of commented out code.  That is either sitting there waiting
for a few things to be fixed (i.e. native mpg encoding) or it is me trying to
test things, but at least you can see what I'm trying.

I am not a programmer, let alone a perl programmer.  I've never written perl,
so please be nice when you read this code.  I had some help from a friend (Paul
Miller <jettero@cpan.org>) and also did a lot of googling.

In order to play the videos in the gallery, you may need to setup the file
extension and set your favorite player to play it when mythtv calls for it.

Utilities/Setup-->Setup-->Media Settings-->Videos Settings-->File Types

Make a new file type "ts" (or whatever extension you set) without the quotes.
Enter this as the command (i.e. for VLC, but you can do whatever):

    vlc --fullscreen --play-and-exit

You may also want to try the internal player, depending on the extension, it does
pretty well also, so you can try this command...

    Internal

Then, make sure the two circles (use default player and ignore) both have X's,
not checks.

Lastly, make sure that the video browser is set to actively scan each time you
visit.  This is important or you won't see your new videos unless you jump
through some hoops.  This is where you set that option:
Utilities/Setup-->Setup-->Media Settings-->Videos Settings-->General Settings
There are 3 things that need to be enabled, labeled "Video Browser Browses
Files" & "Video Gallery Browses Files" & "Video List Browses Files"

It may seem like a lot of work, but it may tide you over until MythTV has full
support for this device.

Here is an example of a crontab entry for a daily show.  To be recorded on
channel 183 for 60 minutes at 8pm (20:00) on every Thursday.  The location of
your "videodump.pl" script may be different.  Replace "user" (in both locations)
with whatever your normal username/account is.

    00 20 * * 4  mythtv   /home/user/temp/videodump.pl -c 183 -t 60 -n TestShow -d
