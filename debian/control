Description: A generic method of dumping a /dev/video0 device using ffmpeg
  Until myth gets support for a certain device under v0.22, at least one of the
  authors of this script were dead in the water.  This script will likely work
  with any hardware (/dev/video*) type device that dumps a video/audio stream.
